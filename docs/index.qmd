The **operetta-compose** package collects [Fractal](https://fractal-analytics-platform.github.io/fractal-tasks-core/)<sup>1</sup> tasks to convert and process images from Perkin-Elmer Opera/Operetta high-content microscopes. It includes workflows for drug response profiling built upon the [OME-ZARR file standard](https://ngff.openmicroscopy.org/latest/).

### Available Fractal Tasks

Currently the following tasks are part of *operetta-compose*

| Task  | Description |
|---|---|
| harmony_to_ome_zarr | Convert TIFFs which were exported from Harmony (Operetta/Opera, Perkin-Elmer) to OME-ZARR |
| stardist_segmentation | Segment cells with Stardist |
| regionprops_measurement | Take measurements using regionprops and write the features to the OME-ZARR |
| feature_classification | Classify cells using the [napari-feature-classifier](https://github.com/fractal-napari-plugins-collection/napari-feature-classifier) and write them to the OME-ZARR |
| condition_registration | Register the experimental conditions in the OME-ZARR |
