The **operetta-compose** package collects [Fractal](https://fractal-analytics-platform.github.io/fractal-tasks-core/) tasks to convert and process images from Perkin-Elmer Opera/Operetta high-content microscopes. It includes workflows for drug response profiling built upon the [OME-ZARR file standard](https://ngff.openmicroscopy.org/latest/).

### Available Fractal Tasks

Currently the following tasks are part of *operetta-compose*

| Task  | Description |   
|---|---|
| harmony_to_ome_zarr | Convert TIFFs which were exported from Harmony (Operetta/Opera, Perkin-Elmer) to OME-ZARR |
| stardist_segmentation | Segment cells with Stardist | 
| regionprops_measurement | Take measurements using regionprops and write the features to the OME-ZARR | 
| label_prediction | Make predictions on the selected wells and write them to the OME-ZARR | 
| condition_registration | Register the experimental conditions in the OME-ZARR |
